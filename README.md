# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project.

In this project, I redesigned a twitter to create opinions about football games. I used a lot of knowledge acquired throughout the Ruby on Rails section, Model/View/Controller concepts, some of bootstrap from previous HTML & CSS, among other knowledge acquired on Microverse to create an MVP for this app.

## Acknowledgements
Design idea was inspired by Gregoire Vella on Behance
